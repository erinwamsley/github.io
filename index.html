<h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
<p>Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term. Climate change is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It may be a change in average weather conditions, or in the distribution of weather around the average conditions (i.e., more or fewer extreme weather events). Climate change is caused by factors that include oceanic processes (such as oceanic circulation), variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions, and human-induced alterations of the natural world; these latter effects are currently causing global warming, and "climate change" is often used to describe human-specific impacts.

<h2>What are the effects of climate change?</h2>
<p>The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. Some of the most common effects include:

* Rising sea levels
* More extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, and heat waves
* Changes in agricultural yields
* Loss of biodiversity
* Human health problems, such as heat stress and respiratory illnesses

<h2>What can we do to address climate change?</h2>
<p>There are a number of things that we can do to address climate change. Some of the most important actions include:

* Reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases
* Investing in renewable energy sources
* Improving energy efficiency
* Protecting forests
* Adapting to the effects of climate change

<h1>Welcome to Climate Change 101</h1>
<p>This website is designed to provide you with accurate and up-to-date information on climate change. You will learn about the causes, effects, and solutions of climate change. You will also find stories, videos, and interactive elements to make your learning more engaging and fun.</p>
<h2>What is climate change?</h2>
<p>Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and weather patterns in a place. Climate change can be natural or human-caused. However, since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere and raise temperatures.</p>
<h2>Why is climate change important?</h2>
<p>Climate change is important because it affects every aspect of life on Earth. Climate change can have negative impacts on health, food security, water availability, biodiversity, and human security. Climate change can also increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, heat waves, wildfires, and storms.</p>
<h2>What can we do about climate change?</h2>
<p>We can do a lot about climate change. We can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, switching to electric vehicles, and adopting a low-carbon lifestyle. We can also adapt to the impacts of climate change by building resilience, enhancing preparedness, and supporting vulnerable communities. We can also raise awareness and take action to demand more ambitious climate policies from our governments and businesses.</p>
